# Progressive Web App (PWA) Boilerplate

This boilerplate provides a basic structure for building a Progressive Web App (PWA) with essential files and directories organized for ease of development and deployment.

## Files and Directories

### `css/styles.css`
- This file contains the CSS stylesheets for styling your PWA's HTML pages. Modify and extend this file to customize the visual appearance and layout of your app.

### `fonts/`
- This directory is optional and can be removed if no custom fonts are used or if Google Fonts are applied directly via `<link>` in `index.html`.

### `html/index.html`
- `index.html` serves as the starting page of your PWA. It includes the necessary meta tags, links to CSS and JavaScript files, and other resources. Customize this file to define the structure and content of your app's home page.

### `html/page1.html` and `html/page2.html`
- These are example additional HTML pages that demonstrate how you can organize multiple pages in your PWA. Modify or add more HTML files as needed for different sections or features of your app.

### `images/`
- This directory contains all the image files used in your PWA. Icons like `android-chrome-192x192.png`, `android-chrome-512x512.png`, and others are essential for PWA manifest and visual appearance across devices.

### `js/main.js`
- `main.js` is the main JavaScript file where you can implement client-side functionality and interactions for your PWA. Customize and extend this file to add dynamic behavior to your app.

### `js/service-worker.js`
- `service-worker.js` is the service worker script responsible for implementing PWA features such as caching strategies, offline support, and background sync. Customize this file to tailor PWA functionalities according to your app's requirements.

### `manifest.json`
- `manifest.json` is a JSON file that provides metadata about your PWA. It includes information like the app's name, icons, theme colors, display mode, and other configuration details required for installation and usage on users' devices.
